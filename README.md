# SUBZero
This is the main repository for the SUBZero (Secure USB Backup Zero).  Credit for python https server skeleton goes to [Rich Moulton](https://github.com/rhmoult/SecurityTools/blob/master/Platform_Independent/Python/httpsWithUpload/src/httpsWithUpload.py).

# TODO
1. Write a SUBZero tutorial
2. Add SUBZero specific file changes (dnsmasq.conf, interfaces, hostapd.conf)
